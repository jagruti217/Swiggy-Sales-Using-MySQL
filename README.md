This project focuses on analyzing Swiggy's sales data using SQL to extract insights related to customers, restaurants, and delivery partners. The goal is to understand key business metrics, such as customer engagement, restaurant performance, and delivery partner efficiency, to help Swiggy make data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview

In this project, I used SQL queries to perform various analyses on the Swiggy dataset. The project involves querying customer data, restaurant reviews and revenue, and delivery partner activity. Key findings include customer order trends, top-rated restaurants, and delivery partner efficiency.
